[{"content":"What is Beamer Beamer is a LaTeX document class designed for creating presentation slides. It provides a set of features and styles to easily craft professional and visually appealing presentations using LaTeX syntax. Users can customize layouts, themes, colors, and incorporate elements like mathematical formulas, images, and tables. Beamer also supports animations and transitions, enhancing the interactivity and visual appeal of presentations. Overall, Beamer is a powerful tool for LaTeX users seeking high-quality typesetting and flexibility in creating presentations.\nHow to use Beamer In Beamer, a slide is composed of several frames. Here, we will discuss how to use Beamer to create frames and some unique feature. In fact, Beamer supports almost all LaTeX syntax, so you can treat each frame as if it were an individual LaTeX document to edit. Therefore, we won\u0026rsquo;t focus on explaining how to populate the content of frames.\nBasic Document Structure % For LaTex Font \\documentclass[fontset=none]{beamer} \\def\\mathfamilydefault{\\rmdefault} % Chinese support \\usepackage{ctex} % Figure settings \\usepackage{caption} \\graphicspath{{assets/}}% Add image path \\setbeamertemplate{caption}[numbered]% Number figures \\captionsetup[figure]{name=Fig.}% When package \u0026#34;ctex\u0026#34; is used, but you perfer \u0026#34;Fig. x：\u0026#34; than \u0026#34;图x: \u0026#34; % Choose a theme \\usetheme{default} \\usecolortheme{whale} % Information for title page \\title{sample title} \\author{sample name} \\institute{sample institute} \\date{January 01, 1970} \\begin{document} \\frame{\\titlepage} % Body text \\section{title1} \\subsection{subtitle1} \\begin{frame} \\frametitle{title1} \\framesubtitle{subtitle1} % Content for the motivation frame \\end{frame} \\subsection{subtitle2} \\begin{frame} \\frametitle{title1} \\framesubtitle{subtitle2} % Content for the method frame \\end{frame} \\end{document} You can refer to this website for theme and color theme previews.\nPotentially useful code snippets End page\n\\begin{frame}{} \\centering \\Large \\emph{END} \\end{frame} Table of contents\n\\begin{frame} % [shrink] is optional when the contents is too long \\addtocounter{framenumber}{-2} % Adjust page numbering \\frametitle{Contents} \\thispagestyle{empty} \\tableofcontents % [pausesections] is optional when this frame only serves as a section\u0026#39;s table of contents \\end{frame} Figures\n\\begin{figure} \\centering \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{file path/file name} \\caption{description} \\label{quote tag} \\end{figure} Unordered lists\n\\begin{itemize} \\item item1 \\item item2 \\end{itemize} Ordered lists\n\\begin{enumerate} \\item item1 \\item item2 \\end{enumerate} ","permalink":"https://add2333.github.io/beamer/","summary":"A brief introduction to the fundamental usage of Beamer.","title":"Beamer Primary Usage"},{"content":"Preparation Even though we had planned to participate a month in advance, we didn\u0026rsquo;t start preparing until the week before the topic was released, and in some cases, even just one day before. So I think we were essentially going into the competition \u0026ldquo;blind\u0026rdquo; or unprepared. I want to outline our degree of preparation in three parts:\nModel: few commonly used models Write: basic frame Program: some code frame of commonly used models (most learning models), haven\u0026rsquo;t tested Process of competition I was the writer in our team.\nDay 1 Morning: Started reviewing the questions two hours after the problem statement was released and spent approximately one hour on it. Since historically the C question in previous competitions could often be addressed using deep learning models, and our programmer had a good understanding of deep learning, we focused our attention on reading the details of the C question (and choose it finally).\nAfternoon: Discussed some critical terms. Tried to understand tennis rules. Programmer started coding. Writer did nothing.\nNight: Programmer \u0026ldquo;addressed\u0026rdquo; the problem 1 and 2 with 70% accuracy . (Sadly it was \u0026ldquo;wrong\u0026rdquo;, and we did not find that until the day 3)\nI felt I was playing the role of modeling. We thought MCM was just so-so. (As it turned out, we underestimated it) Went back to sleep early.\nDay 2 Morning: Writer and Modeler tried to find some related article.\nAfternoon: Wrote some not important part of our essay.\nNight: Used some tricks (it was wrong too) that improve the accuracy to 90%.\nFelt happy.\nDay 3 Morning: We found we seemed used a wrong method.\nAfternoon: We chose to solve these problems using a method with 60% accuracy.\nNight: Drew some pictures, wrote our solution of problem 2 and first part of problem 3.\nFelt anxious and nervous.\nDay 4 Morning: Drew some pictures, wrote our solution of problem 3.\nAfternoon: Tried to improve our accuracy but failed. Wrote our solution problem 5.\nNight: Continued writing solution of problem 5.\nLate Night to early morning: Wrote the other problems, integrated them together.\nExtensively utilized LLM (e.g. ChatGPT) for assistance in writing and translation. We ultimately submitted our paper two hours before the deadline.\nAnalysis Team Advantage: quick and simple communication due to our team members were gathered together programmer have the knowledge of machine learning modeler is an even-tempered person writer can use LaTeX others Disadvantage: everyone is contributing ideas, but there was no single independent authority directing decisions. have no experiences of this kind of competition time arrangement Myself Advantage: LaTeX English reading other Disadvantage: always put huge pressure on team members have no experience and related knowledge English writing and translation other ","permalink":"https://add2333.github.io/retro_of_2024_mcm_icm/","summary":"A short retrospective of 2024 MCM/ICM","title":"Retrospective of 2024 MCM/ICM"}]
